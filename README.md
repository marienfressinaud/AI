# Artificial Intelligence projects

Here I list my AI projects from NTNU (sept. - nov. 2013).

- September project: Quarto game
- October project: Puzzle Solver
- November project: Particule Swarm Optimization

Note they would need some improvements to work perfectly: you can find some comments explaining the code is ok for the exercise but the solution is not perfect. I had to make choices between "ideal solution" and deadlines :).
